# SRB2Kart-Presets
A utility tool for packing SRB2Kart .cfg files and addons into presets.

- When given a .cfg file, this program can pack it and its referenced mods into a .tgz file with some added information for reconstruction.
- When given a .tgz file, this program can copy any necessary mods and produce a .bat file that launches the game with the mods added.
